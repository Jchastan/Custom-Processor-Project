You need to be able to run python code from the terminal to run the assembler since it runs in python.
If you don't know how to do this, here's a youtube video, you are free to figure this out elsewhere: https://youtu.be/hnn682GS_J0
Then, once in the directory that the .py file and the assembler code is in, simply run the code with the
full filename of the assembly code first, followed by the full file name of the output file second as 
arguments. The output file will be created if it doesn't exist beforehand. To be clear the syntax is as follows:
python assembler.py program1.txt out1.txt

since the program files are in each program folder, it should be used as follows:

python assembler.py program1/program1.txt program1/out.txt

with the program number for the program whose machine code should be generated being used.
